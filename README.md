# Project-Landing-Page
Odin Project right after flexbox lesson

Every image on the page is drew myself in MS paint, so i dont think i really need to refer (shout out) anyone other than Odin Project and its community.

I got idea why in execrise we used links and list in header part.

Things has been more clear whenever i use the same terms that i learned in execrise.

The problems that i faced while doing this project was solve through previous execrises and went back and forth alot as well.
